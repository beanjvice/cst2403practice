//let x = 4, y = 10, min; what is the value for min? 

#include <iostream>
int main (){
    int x = 4;
    int y = 10;

    int min = (x<y)? x-2: y-6;
    //        |if part|  |else part| 
}

//prediction: idk cause i have no idea what the ? is 
// answer: min = 2
// the ? is a ternary conditional operator, it works like an if else statement in one line
